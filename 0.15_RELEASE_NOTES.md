  }
}
``````

A new custom data type has been introduced for clients list.

* `add` - Add a client.
* `at` - Get a client by index.
* `concat` - Concatenate with another clients list.
* `delete` - Delete a client from cleints list by it's obejct representation.
* `deleteAt` - Delete a client from clients list by it's index.
* `deleteByKey` - Delete a client from clients list by it's `sessionId`.
* `forEach` - Iterate clients list and pass through a callback.
* `get` - Get a client by it's `sessionId`.
* `includes` - Find whether the given client object is in the clients list.
* `indexOf` - Get the index of a client.
* `map` - Mapping and get a new clients list by passing though a callback.

## Abstract logging support has been added!

It is now supported to add third party/custom logging libraries for printing Colyseus framework related logs. If no logging library has been provided Colyseus will use `console` by default as it's fallback.

i.e. Configuring a third party logging library.

```typescript
import * as winston from "winston";

const LOG: winston.Logger = winston.createLogger({
    format: winston.format.combine(
        winston.format.timestamp(),
        winston.format.json(),
    ),
    level: 'info',
    transports: [
        new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'error.log', level: 'error' }),
        new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'all.log' }),
    ],
});

export default Arena({
    options: {
        logger: LOG
    },

    // ..
});
```

Usage:

```typescript
import { Client, logger } from "@colyseus/core";

export class TicTacToeRoom extends Room<> {

  onCreate (options: any) {
    ...
  }

  onJoin(client: Client, options: any) {
    logger.info(client.sessionId, "joined!");
  }

  onLeave (client: Client, consented: boolean) {
    logger.info(client.sessionId, "left!");
  }

  onDispose() {
    logger.info("room", this.roomId, "disposing...");
  }
}
```
