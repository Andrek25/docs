# Migrating to version 0.15 (from 0.14)

## `@colyseus/loadtest` has been reworked!

The loadtest tool has been reworked to allow for more complex scripting, so your loadtest scripts will need to be slightly rewritten, as the new format looks like this:

```typescript
import { Client, Room } from "colyseus.js";
import { Options } from "@colyseus/loadtest";

export async function main(options: Options) {
    const client = new Client(options.endpoint);
    const room: Room = await client.joinOrCreate(options.roomName, {
        // your join options here...
    });

    console.log("joined successfully!");

    room.onMessage("message-type", (payload) => {
        // logic
    });

    room.onStateChange((state) => {
        console.log("state change:", state);
    });

    room.onLeave((code) => {
        console.log("left");
    });
}
```

## `@colyseus/command`

On latest version of `@colyseus/command` (`0.2.0`), instead of providing the state as a generic when extending the `Command`, you now provide your whole `Room` type:

```typescript
import { Command } from "@colyseus/command";

export class MyRoom extends Room<State> {
    // ...
}

export class MyCommand extends Command<MyRoom> {
    // ...
}
```
