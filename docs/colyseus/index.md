# Welcome to Colyseus

!!! tip "Important Notices"
    - Documentation is currently being updated and improved.
    - Translation of the documentation is in progress.

## Introduction

Colyseus is an Authoritative Multiplayer Framework written in Node.js. When working on a Colyseus project, you will have to write your own logic in the server, and in the client (through one of the Client-side SDK's available)

## Getting started

Before we start, let's make sure we have the necessary system requirements installed in your local machine.

**Requirements**:

- [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14.0 or higher
- [Download and install Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Download and install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or other editor of your choice)

### Creating your server

Use the `npm init colyseus-app` command to create an empty Colyseus server.

```
npm init colyseus-app ./my-first-game-server
```

> We recommend using TypeScript as your main language, although you can use JavaScript if you're more comfortable with it.

#### Establishing client connections

#### Manipulating the state
