# Migrating to version 0.16 (from 0.15)

Use this guide to migrate your existing 0.15 projects to version 0.16.

<!-- See [version 0.16 release announcement](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus/releases/tag/0.16.0). -->

Update all your `@colyseus/*` modules on `package.json` to use version `0.16.0@preview`:

```json
    "@colyseus/schema": "^3.0.0-alpha.0",
    "colyseus": "^0.16.0-preview.0",
    "@colyseus/core": "^0.16.0-preview.16",
    "@colyseus/monitor": "^0.16.0-preview.0",
    "@colyseus/playground": "^0.16.0-preview.0",
    "@colyseus/tools": "^0.16.0-preview.0",
    "@colyseus/uwebsockets-transport": "^0.16.0-preview.0",
```

Make sure you don't have any packages under `0.15.x`, neither `@colyseus/schema` under `2.0.x`.

## Schema callbacks and `$(instance)` proxy

As the callback methods have been extracted out of the `Schema` instances, you now have to get a proxied version of your `Schema` instances via `$(yourInstance)` in order to attach callbacks into them.

```typescript
import { getStateCallbacks } from "colyseus.js";

const room = await client.joinOrCreate("my_room");
const $ = getStateCallbacks(room);

$(room.state).players.onAdd((player, sessionId) => {
    // this is the raw Schema instance
    console.log(player);

    // this is the proxied version, where you can attach the callbacks
    $(player).listen("x", (value, previousValue) => {
        console.log("player.x has been updated!", value, previousValue);
    });
});
```

The proxy is capable of entering nested objects, even if they're not available at the time you're attaching the callback.

```typescript
$(room.state)
    .instance // this is a Schema instance (may not be immediately available)
    .items // this is a MapSchema or ArraySchema (may also not be immediately available)
    .onAdd((item, index) => {
        console.log("item added at index", index);
    });
```

## Sending schema-encoded messages is now deprecated

Sending schema instances as messages via `client.send(instance)` or `this.broadcast(instance)` is now deprecated. This feature it was introduced in previous versions due to lack of strong types in C# for messages.
